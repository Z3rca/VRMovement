VR Movement Solution
This Repository is intended to contain several VR Movement solutions, which were not offered by SteamVR by default. Currently it only contains a Navmesh based Input System, which is handy if your project do not contain any form of jumping. In future I try to update this repository and might add also more solutions for reducing potential Visual Induced Motionsickness.
